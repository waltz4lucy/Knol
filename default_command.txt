It's easy to lose track of all the defaults commands used to perform tweaks to Mac OS X,
but with the help of the history command it's easy to list every defaults write and accompanying defaults delete commands ever used on a Mac.
Launch the Terminal to get started.

See All Defaults Commands Executed
To see all defaults commands, including defaults write, defaults read, defaults delete, and even those requiring sudo:

history |grep "defaults"

Will return something like this:

47 sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow AdminHostInfo HostName
48 sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow AdminHostInfo IPaddress
98 defaults write com.apple.DiskUtility DUDebugMenuEnabled 1
206 defaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeInternalDebugMenu 1
237 defaults write com.apple.dock itunes-notifications -bool TRUE;killall Dock
238 defaults delete com.apple.dock itunes-notifications
239 defaults write com.apple.dock desktop-picture-show-debug-text -bool TRUE;
241 defaults delete com.apple.dock desktop-picture-show-debug-text;killall Dock

See Only Defaults Write Commands
To see only defaults write commands, including those requiring sudo:

history |grep "defaults write"

The results will look the same as above, but without showing any defaults read or defaults delete commands.

See Only Defaults Delete Commands
To see which defaults write commands have been reverted, grep for delete rather than write:

history |grep "defaults delete"

See Defaults Commands Related to Specific App
By changing the text within grep to an application or process name,
we can see which defaults commands were used only for that specific application.
For example, to see only defaults commands that impacted the Finder:

history |grep "defaults write com.apple.finder"

Most apps are easy to find this way, and the default applications in OS X almost always follow the com.apple.appname convention.

We touched on this concept before in a past post about the history command,
but focusing on defaults commands is useful enough to deserve individual recognition.
