>> WoW After the abolition of the 3 0 server settings and synchronization      1/28/2009 12:00:00 AM


If you are a regular share account with others players (not to mention the Blizzard Account is not encouraged to share, many friends and relatives on other people's No. ah herbs, mining what is normal about that), you will find that sometimes your account on their own time by other people to mess Bond changed beyond recognition?

Blizzard said here about 3.0 for the server after the realization of paragraph Save settings approach: each time the line, will call DownloadSettings () above to download from the server settings; each normal line, we will call UploadSettings () From current settings (This is why Alt + F4 off the assembly line or an error when the reasons for setting could not be saved). If banned paragraph sync with the server settings, or the server side has yet to save your settings (such as 3.0 on the first line), it will use the local settings.

Well, Blizzard of course, also provided ways to cancel such settings, the specific settings are as follows:

If you want to cancel all three synchronization settings (interface, key places and macro), enter the following command: 
/ Console synchronizeSettings 0

These settings also can be modified;

Cancel synchronization interface settings: 
/ Console synchronizeConfig 0

Cancel button bit synchronization settings: 
/ Console synchronizeBindings 0

Cancel macro synchronization: 
/ Console synchronizeMacros 0


So you can ignore the server-side saved settings and use of locally set up. If you want to restore the synchronization, please 0 into 1, the implementation of the order.

Modifications, using the current client log on any account will not be synchronized (this setting is written on the config.wtf public settings file inside).


If you want to immediately set up to upload and download: 
Download settings: 
/ Script DownloadSettings ();

From set up immediately: 
/ Script UploadSettings ();


In addition: When the settings from the server after downloading, the old settings file (the path is <WOW Rtem> \ WTF \ Account name \ server name \ [role name \] xxx.wtf) will be automatically added into the original file name suffix. Old, At this point if you use the ALT + F4 out of the game, use this. old file to replace the original file, you can restore the previous settings.

Bindings-cache.wtf is the key bit set 
Config-cache.wtf is the interface settings 
Macros-cache.wtf is a macro
I hope this article can account for the regular players sharing convenience.

serenity update another modification method, without into the game: 
Use Notepad to open <WOW Rtem> \ WTF \ config.wtf, add the following line:

SET synchronizeSettings "0"
SET synchronizeConfig "0"
SET synchronizeBindings "0"
SET synchronizeMacros "0"
