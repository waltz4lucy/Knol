This is because most themes haven't been updated for the new release, yet. There are two solutions atm:
You can remove all new icons by adding the following to the sublime-theme file of your theme:
{
    "class": "icon_file_type",
    "content_margin": [0,0]
},
{
    "class": "icon_folder",
    "content_margin": [0,0]
},
{
    "class": "icon_folder_loading",
    "content_margin": [0,0]
},

You can use the new folder icon system by adding the following section:
{
    "class": "icon_folder",
    "content_margin": [8, 8],
    "layer0.texture": "<theme>/icons/folder.png",
    "layer0.opacity": 1.0
},
    {
    "class": "icon_folder",
    "parents": [{"class": "tree_row", "attributes": ["expanded"]}],
    "layer0.texture": "<theme>/icons/folder_open.png",
    "layer0.opacity": 1.0
},

Modify the texture paths above to point to the folder icons in your theme.
This will probably be more difficult if you are using a theme installed via package control.
