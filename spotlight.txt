Disable Spotlight
The primary method is using launchctl, this will require the administrative password:
sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist

Another approach is to use the older indexing method of "sudo mdutil -a -i off" which turns off indexing only, but more on that in a minute.

Reenable Spotlight
The guaranteed way to reenable Spotlight is to reload it into launchd using launchctl:
sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist

Again, the alternate approach is the indexing related "sudo mdutil -a -i on" command,
but that method can throw the "Spotlight server is disabled" error and not allow you to turn it back on.
If you run into that problem, use the sudo launchctl load command instead to enable both indexing and Spotlight.
